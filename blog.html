            <h1>New research of oldest light confirms age of the universe</h1>
            <p>
              Just how old is the universe? Astrophysicists have been debating
              this question for decades. In recent years, new scientific
              measurements have suggested the universe may be hundreds of
              millions of years younger than its previously estimated age of
              approximately 13.8 billions of years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now new research published in a series of papers by an
              international team of astrophysicists, including Neelima Sehgal,
              PhD, from Stony Brook University, suggest the universe is about
              13.8 billion years old. By using observations from the Atacama
              Cosmology Telescope (ACT) in Chile, their findings match the
              measurements of the Planck satellite data of the same ancient
              light. The ACT research team is an international collaboration of
              scientists from 41 institutions in seven countries. The Stony
              Brook team from the Department of Physics and Astronomy in the
              College of Arts and Sciences, led by Professor Sehgal, plays an
              essential role in analyzing the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
              -- the afterglow light from the Big Bang. "In Stony Brook-led work
              we are restoring the 'baby photo' of the universe to its original
              condition, eliminating the wear and tear of time and space that
              distorted the image," explains Professor Sehgal, a co-author on
              the papers. "Only by seeing this sharper baby photo or image of
              the universe, can we more fully understand how our universe was
              born." Obtaining the best image of the infant universe, explains
              Professor Sehgal, helps scientists better understand the origins
              of the universe, how we got to where we are on Earth, the
              galaxies, where we are going, how the universe may end, and when
              that ending may occur. The ACT team estimates the age of the
              universe by measuring its oldest light. Other scientific groups
              take measurements of galaxies to make universe age estimates. The
              new ACT estimate on the age of the universe matches the one
              provided by the standard model of the universe and measurements of
              the same light made by the Planck satellite. This adds a fresh
              twist to an ongoing debate in the astrophysics community, says
              Simone Aiola, first author of one of the new papers on the
              findings posted to arXiv.org. "Now we've come up with an answer
              where Planck and ACT agree," says Aiola, a researcher at the
              Flatiron Institute's Center for Computational Astrophysics in New
              York City. "It speaks to the fact that these difficult
              measurements are reliable."
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2019, a research team measuring the movements of galaxies
              calculated that the universe is hundreds of millions of years
              younger than the Planck team predicted. That discrepancy suggested
              that a new model for the universe might be needed and sparked
              concerns that one of the sets of measurements might be incorrect.
              The age of the universe also reveals how fast the cosmos is
              expanding, a number quantified by the Hubble constant. The ACT
              measurements suggest a Hubble constant of 67.6 kilometers per
              second per megaparsec.
