              Scientists at Harvard University and the Black Hole Initiative
              (BHI) have developed a new method to find black holes in the outer
              solar system, and along with it, determine once-and-for-all the
              true nature of the hypothesized Planet Nine.

              Sniffing out smell: How the brain organizes information about
              odors
            </p>
            <p>
              Neuroscientists describe for the first time how relationships
              between different odors are encoded in the brain. The findings
              suggest a mechanism that may explain why individuals have common
              but highly personalized experiences with smell.

            <p>
              While the optimization of conventional microelectronics is slowly
              reaching its physical limits, nature offers us a blueprint how
              information can be processed and stored efficiently: our own
              brain. Scientists have now successfully imitated the functioning
              of neurons using semiconductor materials.

              The first intuitive programming language for quantum computers
            </p>
            <p>
              Several technical advances have been achieved recently in the
              pursuit of powerful quantum computers. Now, Computer scientists
              have made an important breakthrough in the field of programming
              languages: their quantum language is the first of its kind that is
              as elegant, simple and safe as classical computer languages.

            <p>Mystery of solar cycle illuminated</p>
            <p>
              The sun's convection zone plays a key role in the generation and
              evolution of the Sun's magnetic field. Analyzing data sets
              spanning more than 20 years, researchers have obtained the most
              comprehensive picture of the north-south flow of plasma in the
              convection zone ever. The flow goes around the convection zone in
              each hemisphere in about 22 years.
